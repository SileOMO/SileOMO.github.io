Mesh is a hardware platform that integrates inertial sensing, a compass and a vibrotactile display into a back pack for a standard iPaq. The objective of Mesh is to provide a platform for prototyping examples of applications that combine haptic, visual and auditory display in a single hand-held device that is capable of communicating with other similar devices. Current examples of such applications are the Body Mnemonics, ContactIM and Topographic Torch projects detailed below.
