It has been over 30 years since there have been significant changes to the technology for creating Refreshable Braille displays. The existing piezoelectric cells are expensive and complex to manufacture, and cannot be packed tightly enough to create a full page of text. Nor are they suitable for creating tactile graphics. In this project, we take a completely new approach, using microfluidic techniques to both actuate and control bubbles to move individual braille dots. Our aim is to create a high-density refreshable tactile array at a much lower cost.
