Following on from work such as the inTouch, ContactIM uses a touch enabled Instant Messaging system to explore the use of haptics in interpersonal communication. As well as text, audio and video, users are able to send one another touch messages. The possible messages that can be sent range from simply throwing a ball (to be caught and then returned), to more complex and personal communications such as handshakes and hugs. We hope to create a system that will provide users with a rich and expressive haptic vocabulary.

One unique aspect of this project is that it is exploring touch communication that does not take place in tightly coupled and interactive scenarios. This means that it does not require the extremely low latency links typical of haptic communication systems, and makes it ideal for use over existing communication technologies such as the Internet.
