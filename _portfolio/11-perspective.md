As the boundaries between real and virtual environments become blurred and we begin to use real objects as handles for objects in virtual scenes, interesting questions relating to the relationship between real objects and their virtual counterparts arise.

In this project we address one such question: What is the effect of cross-modal disparity in "field of view" on our ability to make the link between the behaviour of an object we are holding in the real world and viewing in a virtual environment. To address this question, we designed a series of tasks in which we manipulated the relationship between haptic properties (orientation, number of parts etc.) of the real-world object and visual properties of its virtual counterpart.
